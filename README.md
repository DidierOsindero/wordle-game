## <b>Description✍🏾</b>

### <b>💭What is it?</b>

This is a clone of the classice Wordle game!
<br/><br/>

### <b>💭What have I learnt?</b>

Through this project I learnt about CSS animations, react custom hooks and I also learnt more about working with event listeners. I worked on the algorithm to evaluate the game board alongside my peers on the Academy coding bootcamp. I then decided to actually create a clone of the game and did so with the help of some video tutorials by The Net Ninja (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5YeuERMmlnqo4oq8vwUpg). However as I was keen to learn and discover things myself, I used the videos as an aid but not a strict guide.
